      These Lebanese minced-meat skewers are like the ultimate handmade sausages
      and they’re incredibly simple. Make sure you buy the best-quality minced
      lamb and beef, or even better, mince the meat yourself. If you don’t have
      metal skewers you can simply shape the mixture into patties. Great on the
      barbie, great in a pan, great in the oven, these are just great!

      Kofta or Köfte is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes found in
      South Asian, South Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Balkan, and Central Asian
      cuisines. In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls of ground meat
      usually beef, chicken, lamb or mutton, or a mixture – mixed with spices
      and sometimes other ingredients. The earliest known recipes are found in
      early Arab cookbooks and call for ground lamb.

      There are many national and regional variations. There are also vegetable
      and uncooked versions. Shapes vary and include balls, patties, and
      cylinders. Sizes typically vary from that of a golf ball to that of an
      orange.
